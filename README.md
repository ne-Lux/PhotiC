The Android application PhotiC is used to reorder multiple images at the same time without the need to specify the exact date and time for each image separately.


Introduction
------------

Every time an image is received via an instant messenger, the metadata is deleted. On the receiver's phone the image will pop up in the image gallery at the time where it was received, resulting in a wrongly ordered image gallery. PhotiC is an alternative to the applications out there, where you can specify the exact date and time for one image at a time. If you are looking for a chronologically sorted image gallery without the need to specify the date to the minute, PhotiC is the perfect choice.

Requirements
--------------

- Android SDK 30
- Android Device/Emulator API 30+
